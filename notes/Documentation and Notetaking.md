# Documentation & Note Taking
#meeting 

**Date**:: 2021-08-05
**Attendees:** Cody & Graven  

----
- The long term vision for the Geo Web is to be publicly governed and maintained
- As of right now, only our small team is engaged in the important discussions that will set the trajectory of the project
- Over time, hopefully others will join the conversation
- The challenge we will have is to expose them to the history of conversations, trade-offs, and reasoning behind why decisions were made
- Documentation formalizes and communicates the &quot;way things are&quot; and good documentation should also illuminate rationale behind the design decisions where appropriate
- But there&#39;s also room for a more raw stream of history capturing the design and development of the project
- &quot;[Digital Gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)&quot; and sharing notes
  - [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and other wiki-like note taking tools/communities
  - Cody uses [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  - [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
  - [https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/nontechnical-gardening)
- Take notes during all online and offline discussions and share them publicly
  - Take better notes
  - Create a paper trail for future self to review
