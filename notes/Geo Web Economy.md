# Geo Web Economy

The goal of the Geo Web Economy is to reward stakeholders that are creating value in the network.

Stakeholders include:
- Land owners
- End users
- [[User Agents in the Geo Web|User agents]]
- Creators
- Developers

The economy is funded through network fees and rewards are distributed from these fees to stakeholders who add value to the network.

Land owners -> Network Fees -> Network -> Distributions -> Stakeholders

The protocol should define how network fees are collected and the process behind distributions, but not the distributions themselves.
