This is a guide to using the [[Recommended Garden Editors|editor]] [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the Garden.

Get started by cloning the Garden to your machine and opening the repo as a vault in Obsidian.

## Recommended  Plugins
### Templates
A great core plugin for creating notes from templates.
1. Install from _core plugins_
2. Configure to use `templates/` directory for templates

### [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git)
A community plugin that makes it easy to push/pull changes from Git.

### [Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/)
Allows for complex queries of notes directly in Obsidian.

This is very Obsidian-specific and using queries will not work with other editors and may go against some of the [[About the Garden|principles]] of the Garden.
