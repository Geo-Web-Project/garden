## Why a Garden?

[[Documentation and Notetaking]] The concept of starting a digital garden for the Geo Web came out of @gravenp and @codynhat meeting in Denver in August of 2021.

The goal is to have a set of notes that helps communication among current contributors of the Geo Web as well as helping onboard future contributors and making contributing more accessible.

## Principles
- Garden is open for anyone to read and contribute
	- Should be publicly available
	- Should be easy to fork and view other's contributions
- Garden is accessible to people of all backgrounds
	- Should limit the tools required to access the garden
	- Should stick to well known standards and limit proprietary formats and tools

## Design
The Garden is simply a collection of plaintext files. These plaintext files _should_ be formatted using [Markdown][1]. Links to other notes in the Garden should be formatted using `[[Wikilinks]]`.

The Garden is stored using Git. The main head of the Garden currently lives in [Github][2], but [Radicle][3] is another option that may be more aligned.
