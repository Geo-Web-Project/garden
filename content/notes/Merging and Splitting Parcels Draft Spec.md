# Draft Spec - Merging and Splitting Parcels

- Merging
  - Limit to two parcels only
  - Must have at least one contiguous pair of coordinates from their respective arrays
    - Propose a new path that contains all points (no breaks in path)
  - Accept a new for sale price
    - Front end suggests adding the two values together
  - Calculate new expiration date based on
    - New for sale value
    - Two previous expiration dates (and implicitly the fee balance)
    - Any (required) additional network fee payments
    - 2 week to 2 years still required
  - Need to choose the surviving parcel id
  - Example
    - Both parcels have content
      - Parcel A - Name = Alice Parcel
      - Parcel B - Name = Bob&#39;s Parcel
    - B moves into A
      - Modify A to have all coordinates
      - Burn B?
        - Want to maintain the historical record
        - Can the ownership of a Ceramic Stream be updated?
      - Assets owned by parcels is a different question
        - Can A own B which owns NFT-C?
        - Otherwise need to change ownership of NFT-C from B to A before B is burned
        - Iteration through ALL NFTs owned by land parcels scales as the size of the registry grows. Don&#39;t want want linear(+) growth of the computation
  - How to manage Ceramic streams?
    - As currently constructed, would we just overwrite?
    - In the future, content will be more granularly anchored, so we&#39;d want to enable a merge/diff evaluation
- Splitting
  - Limit to splitting one parcel into two
  - New paths of two parcel must be valid with existing conditions (contiguous, no overlap)
  - User needs to determine two new parcel values
    - UI suggest 50/50
    - User can edit
  - User needs to allocate their network fees across the two parcels
    - Min and max expiration date still apply
    - UI can suggest proportional allocation of network fees based on for sale price
    - User can edit
  - User needs to select one parcel to maintain the ceramic doc lineage
  - Other parcel will need a new ceramic doc
    - Fine to enter new parcel name, links, and gallery in the existing single parcel functions
  - Asset ownership assumption would be that all assets stay with the unchanged parcel ID
    - Give user the option to select which assets to move to the new item?
