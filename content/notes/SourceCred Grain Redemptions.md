# SourceCred Grain Redemptions

SourceCred redemptions are 1 Grain for $1 USD equivalent. As long as there are accessible stablecoin balances in the Geo Web wallets, we will use those. Stablecoins will be assumed to be worth exactly $1 USD.

If stablecoin balances are exhausted, ETH or ERC-20 tokens will be used. The exchange rate will be determined immediately prior to submission of the transaction (although transactions may not immediately be confirmed) from [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) or an alternative public source.

Until there is wider exchange and application support for L2s, all redemption payments will be made on Ethereum mainnet. Redemptions for regular contributors (i.e. those with g balances in the “hundreds of dollars” range) will be processed every two weeks on Sunday or Monday after merge of the latest grain distribution PR.

Wallet addresses for payouts will be maintained in the Gnosis Safe address book. It is the grain recipient’s responsibility to notify Graven of any required changes to payout addresses (i.e., we’ll keep using the same address every redemption period unless notified).
