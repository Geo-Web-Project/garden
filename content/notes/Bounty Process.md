# Bounty Process

## Overview
The Geo Web project uses some of its community funds to sponsor open bounties for technical, creative, or community tasks. These bounties are posted under the "Issues" tabs of the repositories in the [Geo Web Github organization](https://github.com/Geo-Web-Project). 

Bounties are typically denominated and paid in ETH, but some exceptions will apply and will be noted in the ticket. The Geo Web is an open source project and will never accept venture equity funding, so our bounties will likely pay less than the "market rate" on average. That said, if you think our estimate level of effort is wildly off and the intrinsic value of contributing to our mission doesn't cover the delta, let us know. We'll see what we can do.

If you sign up to complete one or more bounties in a calendar year with a nominal USD value greater than $600, we are required to collect tax information (or an exemption) to comply with US tax regulations.

Bounties are open to all. We just ask that prospective contributors exercise their best judgment in signing up for bounties that they have both the time and the skill set to complete. **Important note: that doesn't mean don't challenge yourself with something new... the whole Geo Web is basically new.**

Bounties are only assigned to one contributor at a time. If a contributor goes cold (i.e., stops sharing updates, communicating, pushing code, etc.), the Geo Web project admins reserve the right to reassign the ticket. Partial payment for partially completed work will only be made in exceptional cases (bounty scope is typically small enough that it just makes sense that it's all or nothing).

## Claiming a Ticket
To claim a ticket, comment on it expressing your interest and share rough estimate of when you complete the work. Instead of complex/overbearing IP assignment agreements, we ask that you include the following statement on your claim comment as well:

"I agree to open source all the work that I do on behalf of this bounty and dual-license it under MIT and APACHE2 licenses."

A project admin will review prospective bounty claims and assign the ticket to the first credible claimant. 

## Submission Process
When work on a bounty is complete, contributors should create a PR to merge their work back into the "Main" repository branch. 

Assign both @codynhat (technical review) and @gravenp (administrative review) as reviewers of the PR unless otherwise noted in the ticket.

Bounties are paid upon successful merging of the PR(s) that satisfy all the requirements included in the ticket. 

@gravenp will privately contact contributors to collect wallet address and tax information (if appropriate).
