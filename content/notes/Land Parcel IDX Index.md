# Land Parcel IDX Index

The [[NFT DID Integration|NFT DID Method]] allows each parcel to have an IDX index. Existing IDX definitions can be used along with a Geo Web specific definitions.

Thus, the "root stream" is really the IDX index.

Browsers can find the index by using the NFT DID Resolver to derive the DID and then use IDX to fetch the index.
