#  Geo Web Roles in The Graph

The Geo Web uses The Graph as a core piece of the protocol to query the land registry. It is the equivalent of DNS queries.

DNS: Name -> IP address
The Graph: GPS coordinates -> Root Stream Id

The Graph network has different [roles][1], including indexers, curators, delegators, and consumers.

## Curator

The Geo Web will have its own subgraph. It can also be a _curator_ in The Graph to signal to indexers that the subgraph should be indexed. The DAO could use the treasury to purchase GRT and signal.

## Indexer

The Geo Web team or foundation could also be an indexer that is only indexing the Geo Web subgraph.

## Delegator

The Geo Web team could also delegate "good" nodes that are indexing the subgraph.

## Consumer

The Cadastre and browsers will have different models for consuming from The Graph. They could pay on behalf of users, or have different business models for accepting payment from users.
